# chatbot
This Python script creates a simple terminal-based chatbot. It responds to user inputs like greetings, questions about Python or AI, jokes, and more using if-elif conditions. The chat continues in a loop until the user types "bye", which ends the conversation. It's a beginner-friendly project to practice input handling and conditional logic.
